DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ROMS_NATIVE_READER AND ECOM_READER_3D

1)Changed names in variable mapping according to ECOM

2) Changed sigma levels to z-levels, so ignored self.zlevel to wich sigma levels would be interpolated.

3)Nonesistent gls_param at ECOM

4) All vertical indexing changed to 'z'

5) Defined a function to find nearest value between array and scalar (depth value)

6) Found nearest value between z from dataset and z from requested variables ==> defined indz


CHANGES AT BASEREADER

1) Pixelsize changed onto defined lat and lon values, must be fixed later.

CHANGES AT MODELS

1) 3D models were comented at wave_signifcant_height, variable not in ECOM_dataset
